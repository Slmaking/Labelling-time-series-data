Certainly, if you're looking for alternative methods to interpret and understand feature importance in neural networks, here are some:

1. **Saliency Maps**: 
   - This is one of the simplest approaches to understanding which features are important for a neural network.
   - It involves computing the gradient of the output with respect to the input. In essence, this will tell you how much the output changes concerning a small change in the input.
   - High gradient values indicate that a small change in that feature leads to a large change in the output, thus implying its importance.

2. **Integrated Gradients**:
   - This is an extension of the saliency maps and is designed to provide more accurate attributions.
   - It involves integrating the gradients over the entire path of an input feature from its baseline (or reference point) to its current value.

3. **Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping)**:
   - This method uses the gradients of the target variable concerning the feature maps of a convolutional layer to understand which regions in the image are important.
   - While this is more popular for visualizing important regions in images, it can be adapted to structured data by reshaping the data into a 2D grid and interpreting it similarly.

4. **Feature Ablation**:
   - It involves changing a feature value and observing the difference in model output. This is a more direct way of understanding the impact of each feature.
   - For each feature, set it to a "neutral" value (e.g., mean or median for that feature) and measure the model's performance. The difference in performance with and without the feature gives an estimate of its importance.

5. **LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations)**:
   - LIME is a model-agnostic tool that approximates your complex model with a simpler, interpretable model for a given instance.
   - It perturbs the input data, observes the changes in predictions, and then trains a simpler model (like linear regression) on this perturbed data set to approximate the predictions of the complex model.
   - The coefficients of the simpler model can be interpreted as feature importance for the specific instance.

6. **Activation Maximization**:
   - This is a visualization technique where the input is modified to maximize the activation of certain neurons in the network. It can give insights into what patterns or features the neuron has learned to recognize.
  
7. **Counterfactual Explanations**:
   - Counterfactuals provide explanations in the form of "What changes are needed in the input features to change the model's prediction to a desired output?" 
   - This method can give insights into which features need slight or significant changes to affect the model's output.

When considering these methods, remember that neural networks are highly complex and non-linear, so any interpretability method will be an approximation. The right method often depends on the specific context and what you're most comfortable with.
